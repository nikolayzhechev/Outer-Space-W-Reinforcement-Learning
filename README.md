# Outer Space With Reinforcement Learning

This project explores space activities using reinforecement learning, a branch of deep learning focusing on the study of agents and how they learn by trial and error in a specific environement. In the project unitilized are the most common techinuques in the field, aiming to teach our agent (space craft) how to autonomously navigate space environments of different kinds.
The aim is to establish an understanding and idea of what are the best practices and what works well and where are the posabilities for further expansion.

### Project Structure:

- The `Main` Jupyter notebook contains the main project.

- `Draft` and `Draft_2.0` are also kept for referance.

- A `Figures` folder is used to store images.
    - `Results` includes images with results and performance.

- The `Models` folder includes:
    - Jupyter notebooks with RL experiments and tests.
    - Python files with test environments.
    - Additional helper files.
    - `Lunar_Lander` contains an implementation with a custom agent, model and notebook.
    - `best_model` consists of trained models which some are saved for referance.
    - `logs` has tensor board logs from training and tests.
