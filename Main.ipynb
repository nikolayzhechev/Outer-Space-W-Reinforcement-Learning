    "### Abstract\n",
    "Space exploration methods are being improved upon with every day. Humanity is on the forefront of embarking on the journey of exploring space and reach new points in development. Traversing the vast land of space is undertaken mostly by machines and crafts that are of course operated mainly by humans. It is very plausible that for the foreseen future the vast amount of exploration will be performed by machinery. Machines that are classified as robots.  \n",
    "Robots were sent multiple times, most notably to Mars and perform very substantial exploration on the surface on their own. This is accompanied by human supervision and instructions. Similarly in space environments, crafts perform multiple manoeuvres and decisions based on telemetry and computer programming.  \n",
    "Space crafts require mission control and multiple people on the ground to perform communication and frequent monitor. Artificial intelligence (AI) can step in and take control of space craft making them more effective and autonomous. In general this evolution for robots and machinery seems natural. Due to the vast expanse of space and limitless possibilities in space exploration an AI robot can learn and adapt to environments very effectively.  \n",
    "One process that produces good results is reinforcement learning (RL). In this situation the robot will be placed in an environment where it can perform actions. During traversing it will be rewarded or punished based on the action taken. This approach will be put to the test, leveraging multiple techniques. This project will present a few starter points and explore existing methods and technologies RL in space exploration.\n",

    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Briefly on RL\n",
    "The main characters of RL are the agent and the environment. Agents are put in an unfamiliar environment and are rewarded or punished based on their actions. The main goal of the agent is to maximize the reward amount while traversing the environment. To describe is briefly, RL consists of **state** $s$ which is a complete description of the world. An **observation** $o$ is a description of the state which can be partial or full. Actions that an agent takes are mostly defined as **action space** which are the set of valid actions split into two: **discrete** where there is a finite number of moves available to the agent and **continuous**, in which the agent controls a robot in a physical world. The type of action space will have an impact on what algorithm will be implemented. Importantly the agent, also performs much of it's reasoning via a policy. It is a rule used to decide what action to take. It can be deterministic ( $a_t = \\mu(s_t)$ ) or stochastic ( $a_t \\backsim \\pi(\\cdot \\mid s_t)$ ). Actions are formed from the policy, the sequence of actions is the trajectory which is the states and actions in the world. The goal is to maximize reward over a trajectory which would be defined by the **reward function** ($R$). It depends on the current action taken, the state of the world and the next state ($r_t = R (s_t, a_t, s_t + 1)$).  \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Words on environments\n",
    "Environment definition depends on the task at hand. While there are multiple available environments for prototyping and experimentations, setting up a custom environment for this task was a primary goal. A custom environment however, requires substantial testing and debugging as well as some domain knowledge. A good approach is to start with a simple, base environment and run tests on top of it gradually increasing the environment complexity and add further features while iterating over the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Approach\n",
    "The approach here is testing on multiple environments while mostly simple there are a few more complex aspects within them. The RL agents performed much better on simpler environments which were iteratively improved and updated. Multiple algorithms were tested and initial measures and results are shown. Additionally, there are tests with popular frameworks and tools in the domain of RL. Some are more difficult to start with and some provide meaningful details a bit better.  \n",
    "A description of how the reward scheme and policy is provided and further elaboration on the environment creation is also explained. The code implementation is available.  \n",
    "The methods and results are shared in the next section where general spacecraft mission challenges and ideas, example trajectories and implementations as well as results and comparisons.\n",

    "There are a few questions that are a good start for this tasks: How will an algorithm perform on our environment? Can the algorithm's hyperparameters be tuned to learn and grow it's rewards? Or should the environment be tuned, so that the algorithm is more effective? What do we measure? How many time steps will each trial or run contain?

After testing a few implementations which weren't very good in terms of library execution and engine interaction, setting up a basic lunar lander with the help of Gymnasium proved to be one of the first successful attempts (figure 1).

    "Looking at the hyperparameters which showed improvement after updates: **learning rate** is the step size that is used by the optimizer to update the neural network weights. A smaller value (e.g., 1e-4) results in slower learning but more stability, whereas a larger value (e.g., 1e-2) leads to faster convergence but might cause instability. The **replay buffer** will help the agent to store past experiences (state, action, reward, next state) in this buffer and samples from it for training. A larger buffer retains more diverse experiences but requires more memory. The **batch size** is the number of samples drawn from the replay buffer for training at each update. A larger batch size (e.g., 128) provides more stable updates but requires more computation. A smaller batch size (e.g., 32) results in more frequent updates but can be noisy. **Gamma** is the discount factor, which determines the importance of future rewards. A value close to 1 (e.g., 0.99) makes the agent prioritize long-term rewards. A lower value (e.g., 0.8) makes the agent focus more on short-term rewards. **Train frequency** is at which the model is trained. A value of 4 means the model updates every 4 steps. A lower value (e.g., 1) updates more frequently, while a higher value (e.g., 10) updates less often. The **gradient steps** hyperparameter determines how many gradient updates are performed per training step. When the agent trains, it samples a batch of experiences from the replay buffer and updates the neural network using backpropagation. The default value is typically 1, meaning one gradient update per training step. If gradient_steps > 1, the model updates multiple times using the same batch of data.\n",

    "To improve these results even more a customization on the policy network is also possible. We can input `policy_kwargs`. For example [256, 256] which sets more neurons per layer suitable for more complex and high-dimensional spaces. A three layer architecture can also be considered: [128, 128, 64]. Experimentation with different batch sizes is beneficial and impacts performance 16, 32 or for a higher value 256.

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "For this topic of RL tested were a few methods on how a policy can be set up to effectively converge in an environment resembling space. Approaches were focused on simplicity, exploration and understanding the basics while attempting to measure everything. Complex environments require much more testing, visualisation and evaluating the results under the hood. To expand and learn from this project a very good start is to begin with predefined environments which are already fully setup and configured, improve them and check the results. From there onwards a simple environment can be setup as well as a simple policy and stable reward scheme and improve and update them iteratively. It is very useful to take time and visualise all of the results and if possible visualise what the agent is doing in terms of movement since this will reveal patterns that can be addressed. There is a plethora of 2D, 3D engines for crafting a good simulation but expanding on the policy and setting up a good agent will also be very important. Training might be intense in some scenarios, so leveraging stable compute power will help.\n",
