    "#### Abstract\n",
    "Space exploration methods are being improved upon with every day. Humanity is on the forefront of embarking on the journy of exploring space and reach new points in development. Traversing the vast land of space is undertaken mostly by machines and crafts that are of course operated mainly by humans. It is very plausable that for the foreseen future the vast amount of exploration will be performed by machinery. Machines that we can easily call robots.  \n",
    "Robots were sent multiple times, most notably to Mars and perform very substansial exploration on the surface on their own. This is acompanied by humen supervision and instructions. Similarly in space enviroments, crafts perform multiple manuevers and desicions based on telemtry and computer programing.  \n",
    "Space crafts require mission control and multiple people on the ground to perform communication and frequent monitor. Artificial inteligence (AI) can step in and take control of space craft making them more effective and autonomouse. In general this evolution for robots and machinery seems natural. Due to the vast expanse of space and limitles possabilities in space exploration an AI robot can learn adapt to evnironments very effectively.  \n",
    "One process that produces good results is reinforecement learning (RL). In this situation the robot will be placed in an enivronment where it can perform actions. During traversing it will be rewarded or punished based on the action taken. This approach will be put to the test, leveraging multiple techniques. This work will present a starter point and explore multiple existing methods and technologies for RL.\n",

    "#### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Briefly on RL\n",
    "The main characters of RL are the agent and the environment. Agents are put in an unfamiliar environment and are rewarded or punished based on their actions. The main goal of the agent is to maximize the reward amount while traversing the environment. To describe is briefly, RL consists of **state** $s$ which is a complete description of the world. An **observation** $o$ is a description of the state which can be partial or full. Actions that an agent takes are mostly defined as **action space** which are the set of valid actions. Split into two, **discrete** where there is a finite number of moves available to the agent and **coninuous**, in which the agent controls a robot in a physical world. The type of action space will have an impact on what algorithm will be implemented. Importantly the agent, also performs much of it's reasoning via a policy. It is a rule used to decide what action to take. It can be deterministic ( $a_t = \\mu(s_t)$ ) or stochastic ( $a_t \\backsim \\pi(\\cdot \\mid s_t)$ ). Actions are formed from the policy, the sequence of actions is the trajectory which is the states and actions in the world. The goal is to maximize reward over a trajectory which would be defined by the **reward function** ($R$). It depends on the current action taken, the state of the world and the next state ($r_t = R (s_t, a_t, s_t + 1)$).  \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Words on environments\n",
    "Environment definition depends on the task at hand. While ther eare multiple avaiable environments for prototyping and experimentations, setting up a custom environment for this task was a primary goal. A custom environment however, requires substantial testing and debugging as well as some domain knowledge. A good approach is to start with a simple, base environment and run tests on top of it. Gradually increase the environment complexity and add further features.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Approach\n",
    "The approach here is testing on multiple environments while mostly simple there are a few more complex aspects within them. The RL agents performed much better on simpler environments which were iteratevelly improved and updated. Multiple algorithms were tested and initial mesures and results are shown. Additionally, there are tests with popular frameworks and tools in the domain of RL. Some are more difficult to start with and some provide meaningfull details a bit better.  \n",
    "A description of how the reward scheme and policy is provided and further elaboration on the environment creation is also explained. The code implementation is available.  \n",
    "The methods and results are shared in the next section where general spacecraft mission challenges and ideas, example trajectories and implementations as well as results and comparisons.\n",

    "There are a few questions that are a good start for these type of tasks: How will an algorithm perform on our environment? Can the algorithm's hyperparameters be tuned to learn and grow it's rewards? Or should the environment be tuned, so that the algorithm is more effective? What do we measure? How many time steps will each trial or run contain? If a terminal state is not reached after n steps, will we artificially terminate the episode?

    "This illustrated good results once again and the agent was reaching the goal seemingly in an optimal way. Now the reward seemed to be more gradual and spikes were eliminated which suggested a more linear model and refined refward scheme (figure 4).  \n",

    "Using the same space exploration environment which proved to be a good starting point and had potential for furhter configuration, a comparison was done between the algorithsm DQN, PPO and A2C. This test was important to understand how the agents differed and what hyperparameter changes and optimizations did to the results. The commulative reward reflects the total score achieved by the agent and gives a good indication of its overall success in the environment.\n",
    "After some tuning the agents started to see rewards and perform stabler overall. A2C was the one that had most fluctions and didn't provide good results in initial training. DQN and PPO on the other hand are much more stabler and are rising in terms of reward.\n",

    "DQN (Green) performs the best, achieving the highest and most stable rewards over time. PPO (Blue) is also stable and competitive but slightly lower than DQN in terms of rewards. Both DQN and PPO show steady improvement, stabilizing at higher rewards, while A2C remains volatile with generally negative performance. For the comulative results DQN accumulates rewards at a better rate than PPO, meaning it learns a more efficient policy over time.\n",

    "#### Conclusion\n",
    "Complex environments require much more testing, visualisation and evaluating the results under the hood. To expand and learn from this project a very good start is to begin with predefined environments which are already fully setup and cofigured, improve them and check the results. From there onwards a simple environment can be setup as well as a simple policy and stable reward scheme and improve and update them over time. It is very usefull to take time and visualise all of the results and if possible visualise what the agent is doing."
